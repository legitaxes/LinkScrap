## LinkScrap - sending Promotions and Offers to a designated Telegram Channel âœ¨

LinkScrap scraps data from [Trust Partner Deals Website]("https://trustbank.sg/partner-offers/deals/") and sends the message in this format:

```
[Company Name]
[A Short Description of what they wrote on their website]
[A TinyURL link to the promotion details that which brings the user straight to the Trust Partner Deals Website to find out more info about the promotion]
```

### Here's an image to illustrate the above:

Currently this script only scraps the entirety of the [Trust]("https://trustbank.sg/partner-offers/deals/") website and process these text in a very scuffed manner.

In the future, I hope to further expand it and make it update monthly by itself (somehow) and only push messages for new promos instead of pushing all of the existing promos.

See [Issue #1](https://github.com/legitaxes/LinkScrap/issues/1) on the to do task list.
